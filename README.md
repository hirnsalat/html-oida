# HTML, oida. A slightly less minimalist Pandoc HTML template.

You know what's great? [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). You know what's slightly less great? The readability of it's default HTML template. So I copied over the 7 CSS declarations from the [Better *beep*ing Website](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/). You're welcome.

## How do I use this?

Refer to the [Pandoc documentation](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates) for now. I'll update this section when I get around to it.

## Does it still support syntax highlighting, MathJax and other fancy Pandoc features?

Of course. Unless I broke something.
